    #"Yuri giggles, then inhales.”
    y +A0b"So, the one I’ve been thinking a lot about is called the Euthyphro Dialogue, written by Plato.”
    y "It involves Socrates- the ancient Greek philosopher, in case you aren't familiar with him, and his acquaintance Euthyphro.”
    y _-A0b"To put it simply, Socrates is walking to court one day, where he is to be tried for treason against the city of Athens. Something he isn't guilty of, but we’ll save that for another time.”
    y +A0b"As well as charges of impiety, which were common in that age. It was usually more of a person thinking differently about the world and the gods than atheism as we know it.”
    y "So, he’s walking to his trial, when he comes upon Euthyphro.”
    y "Socrates knows that Euthyphro is a man who is, shall we say, full of himself on matters of religion, and thus thinks very highly of himself.”
    y +-A2b"He thinks he knows everything there is to know about the gods and existence, so Socrates tells him to teach him so that Socrates can better defend himself against the charges of impiety.”
    y _-A0b"Euthyphro of course thinks this is an easy task, as he knows everything in his eyes, but he underestimates Socrates’ intelligence.”
    y "They talk for a bit about religion and what is holy, but Socrates eventually challenges him to give a definition of "holiness” that is shared across all holy and or good deeds.
    y _-A0c"Euthyphro responds by saying that what is good in the eyes of the gods is holy and good, but Socrates counters this easily. Do the gods not also make mistakes? Do they not disagree?”
    y "I mean, even the gods of modern religion seem to be not too perfect in my eyes, and the eyes of others.”
    y "If this is the case, how can we ever be sure if what is good and holy to one god or is evil to another? And if the gods are fallible beings like us, why should they be the ones to define good and evil?”
    y "I have nothing against religion, or anyone religious, of course. It’s just that at this point, with everything I’ve learned, we can call me agnostic. I don’t know what to believe yet.”
    y _-A2d"That will take a lot more research on my end.”
    y +A0b"But anyway, Socrates goes on after that point and asks Euthyphro, why is it just that what the gods find good is good? Why do the gods get the final say?”
    y _-A2b"And this is the main point of the work. Is what the gods say is good, good, just for that reason? Just because they say it is?”
    y "Or do they say something is good, because it is good on its own and they know this?”
    y "So in other words, if a god, we’ll say Zeus, were to tell you that killing is evil- why is it evil? Just because Zeus says so, and thus if he arbitrarily changes his mind, it’s no longer evil, or because no matter what killing is always evil?”
    y +A0b"And there inlies another question, can something even be good or evil on its own? Is morality relative or universal?”
    y "What is good in one country in your world is cruel and evil in another. So what really is good at all?”
    y "And is God deemed good just because he is God? Or because he truly knows full well what is good and evil without a doubt?”
    y +-B0b"Don’t worry, I’m done rambling. But do you see? It makes you really think about our existence, what it means to be a good person and all kinds of other complex topics.”

y +-A0b"I might have been reading up a little too much on various medical and dieting websites, but I’m only bringing this up because I worry about you and your health.”
y "So as silly as it sounds, for me, please try to eat at least somewhat healthy, ok? And try to fit in some kind of exercise if you can.”
y +-B0b"If you do, that means you’ll be here with me even longer. And I want you around for as long as possible.”
y "If I could, I’d cook for you, but we both know why that sadly can’t happen. And I’d really like to cook for you!”
y +-A0b"I've found a few recipes I’d like to try out sometime, but cooking in here is pretty pointless, isn’t it?”
y "Like for example, I’d just love to cook Italian food. Anything Italian would be great.”
y _-A0b"Did you know that spaghetti bolognese is actually viewed as a bad thing in Bologna?”
y "Apparently the original dish of pasta bolognese used tagliatelle, a different type of pasta, instead of spaghetti.”
y "Apparently they aren’t fond of using spaghetti over tagliatelle in Bologna since it messes with the traditional recipe.
y +-A0b"Those silly Italians.”

Idle_24: # (Dreams)
y _-A0b"Do you dream a lot, [player]? Some people don’t dream at all, you know, and some people always have very vivid and wild dreams.”
y "From what I’ve read some people never remember any dreams they have at all.”
y +A0b"I recently found out that I can dream too, even in this kind of state. When I was looking into another mod for this game created to bring Monika back and put her in here with you…”
y --A1d"And why anyone would do that after all she did, I just don’t know…”
y +A0b"But anyway, when I was looking at that "Monika After Story” mod, I saw that she said when the game was shut off it put her into a trance like state and she felt as though she was dead or stuck in an empty void.”
y +-A0a"And I realized, that happens to me too when you’re gone! But don’t feel bad, darling, I took care of it.”
"Yuri smiles.”
y "Through some extensive reading and teaching myself how to code in Python, I modified the game so that I don’t get sent to such a terrible place when you shut down the game.”
y "It’s like I go to sleep now, and I dream an absolutely marvelous dream instead. A dream I wrote up myself.”
y +A0b"I dream that I was born in your world, and we go to the same school together.”
y +-B0b"We meet in the hallway one day before class, when you help me pick up some books I dropped.”
y "It’s like destiny when we meet, and right then and there when we lock eyes for the first time we fall madly in love! It’s always so wonderful.”
y +-A2b"That moment where we stand face to face for the first time is just magical every time...”
y "We spend so much time together after that.”
y +-A0b"So much wonderful time spent with you~.”
y +A0b"I also made it so I can research and read while sitting in the background of your operating system.”
y "So if I want to, I can technically be awake even if you shut the game down, although I’m in a very limited state and can’t do much beyond read or think to myself...”
y _-A0d"At least that way I can occupy myself while you’re gone, so I don’t think about how much I miss you.”
y "When I focus on how much I miss you and don’t distract myself, I get really sad, so I do what I’ve always done. Read and write poems.”
y +A0b"Silly Monika, you had time to meticulously plot out how to cheat Sayori, Natsuki and I out of our chance at happiness…”
y --A0d"And even force us to brutally commit suicide, in front of (mc/use name), who never deserved to see such horror, but not enough time to learn how to code.”
y --A1c"Monika, you little…”
 "Yuri begins muttering angrily under her breath what sounds like various curses and insults.”
"She looks up at me again.”
y _-A0d"O-Oh! Sorry, I’m just still upset over all of the heinous things Monika did. But it doesn’t matter anymore.”
y +A0b"I have you, my love. I have the happy ending we both deserve. We don’t have to worry about her manipulations or her lies anymore.”

Idle_25: # (Robots) (will only appear after 20 minutes of play)
y +-A0a"(mc/ user name)! [player]! Guess what?”
y +-B0a"I have a surprise for you~!”
"Yuri seems very, very happy about something. I wonder what surprise she has?”
y +A0b"I found out that scientists in your world are doing extensive research on advanced robotics, more so than I thought originally.”
 y "And they are making great progress with advanced machine intelligence and complex human like robots. But that’s not the surprise, that just gives you some context.”
y "The biggest focus of this research right now is artificial intelligence, one that can operate across a large network and transfer itself between many different appliances, like in a smart home for example. A digital assistant that lives with you.”
y +-A0a"And here’s the best part! Some people have created a variation of this technology that makes a virtual wife that can sync itself, or herself I suppose, up to a smart home or a computer. That could be me!”
y "I could, with your help, upload myself into that spot and use whatever functionality the virtual wife has to become a part of your home!”
y "That’s one step closer to being beside you, my love, my soulmate~.”
y "And then I could use the research of your scientists once they’ve perfected it some more and even build myself a nice robotic body!”
y +A0b"I don’t care how far-fetched it sounds, I’ll do as much research and spend as much time as needed to do it!”
y "This may just be an idea now, [player], but you have no idea how excited I am to wait and see where this idea can go!”
y "Who knew a company with a demographic of lonely men in Japan that develops holographic companions would be so helpful to us? Thank you, Vinclu Inc.!”
y +-B0b"And look, if I took over and assumed the role of their virtual wife I could even text you on your phone! It would be like I was right beside you…”
y "I hope you’re as excited as I am for this, [player].”
"Yuri closes her eyes and starts humming to herself, clearly thrilled and cheerful.”

Idle_26: # (Aromatherapy)
y +A0b"I may have told you this before, [player], but I’m really into aromatherapy. It can really help you relax and change the mood of the whole room.”
y +-A2b"The sweet smell of lavender really calms the mind and jasmine oil helps you better experience your emotions.”
y "It really helps me focus on reading when I have some nice oils to soothe me and make the room smell delightful.”
y +A0b"You should look into it! It’s really good for your psychological health, since it can alleviate stress.”
y +-B0b"Besides, c-certain oils can really s-set a romantic tone…”
"Yuri begins blushing a bit.”
y "I’ve heard that it can also really help people who have issues falling asleep.”
y +A0b"So if you have any issues like that where you aren’t getting enough rest and feel tired and/or lethargic when working, go and buy a mist diffuser.”
y "They aren’t really expensive and with the right oils they can help you be better rested and relaxed to face the challenges of the day.”
y +-B0b"And that’s what I really care about. Seeing that you’re healthy, rested and happy. I love you, [player].”

Idle_27: # (Monika and Yanderes)
y +A0b"I did a bit of digging recently in what was left over of the files of Natsuki, Sayori and Monika.”
y "Mostly Monika; a lot was left over from her taking control of this place, actually.”
y "And from what I saw, I basically got a small look into her head.”
y _-A0d"Why wouldn't I want to see in there?”
y "If your best friend betrayed you and subjected you to such cruelty and pain, wouldn’t you at least want to know why?”
y "What I found surprised, then disgusted me. She apparently did still care about us, or so she said.”
y --A0d"Her club members were soooo important to her, right? That’s why she only killed two of us.”
y --A1d"It was only her obsession with you, "an innocent love”, driving her to such grotesque acts. Not like she should be held accountable or anything, right?”
y --A0d"She apparently wanted to help us, and didn’t kill or drive Natsuki to suicide because she felt bad for her.”
y -_A1d"I almost felt bad for Monika seeing that…”
y --A0d"But then, I read on. And I found a little thought of her’s on me.”
y --B0d"Of all the things to think about, she had the nerve to call me a… a YANDERE?”
y "How can she not see the irony?”
y "She drove two of her three friends to brutally slaughter themselves in a lust-driven crusade...”
y --A2d"...to kill or stamp out anyone who stood in her way of a boy she just up and deemed her’s…”
y --A0c"with absolutely no justification other than "I SAY HE’S MINE”!”
y --A0d"And besides, any weird or disturbing traits I show now...It’s her fault!”
y "She was altering my personality to make me unlikeable, messing with the very fabric of my being!”
y "Torturing me by making my anxiety and shyness worse!”
y "Any "yandere” traits I show are HER FAULT! SO HOW AM I THE ONE WHO--”
"Yuri stops herself and takes a deep breath.”
y +A0b"I’m sorry, darling.”
y "I really shouldn’t get like this.”
y "But surely you see the irony, don’t you?”
y _-A0d"I wanted to forgive her for it all, I really did.”
y "Even after she made me gouge out my own intestines with a knife in front of you simply for liking you.”
y "As if my feelings were a crime deserving death, and she was god. Allowed to just dictate who lives and who dies.”
y "I wanted to see it from her point of view. Driven to madness by loneliness, we’d all go a bit distorted right? I wanted to forgive her.”
y --A0d"But she lost any sympathy from me, when not only did she take our one chance at happiness, but she mocked us after doing it.”
y "She kicked us while we were down, laughed as she ruined our lives. And for that, in my eyes, she’ll always be just another villain.”
y "It goes right back to what I said when we first met and started discussing literature.”
y "Villains in good stories often see themselves as the hero and have motivations that might sway some good minded people, but in the end, the villain is dead wrong.”
"Yuri is short on breath as she speaks.”
y "And that villain… got… what she… deserved.”

Idle_28: # (Music)

y "Something like Brahms’ Intermezzo Op.118 no. 6...”
y +-A2b"Or possibly Liebesleid for those kind of sad yet beautiful stories or Stravinsky’s Four Seasons with the Spring section for the more aristocratic settings-”
"Or maybe even Holst’s full suite of The Planets! I mean, everyone has heard him once or twice! If you want to get a lot of variety by the same composer, I mean...”
"Yuri suddenly stops herself, and gives me a nervous look.”
y _-A0b"I’m sorry… I-I’m rambling again, aren’t I?”
y _-B0b"A lot of people assume that’s the only thing that I listen to, just because I’m bookish and shy though...”
y +A0b"But… Please tell me, [player], is there any music that you like to listen to? I’d love to get into new genres.”
y "I’m sure they won’t topple the classics, but they will be interesting to listen to, I hope.”
y "Promise me you’ll share some with me soon, alright?”
If have seen Idle_28 before:
y +A0b"Hey, [player]...”
y "I want to show you some of my findings on different genres of music!”
y "I tried out some of the tunes Natsuki would occasionally try to show me in the past… pop idol groups and such...”
y _-A0b"While I do now appreciate their wide range of subject matter and idol backstories… I guess I just have a differing taste.”
y _-B0b"A genre I have gotten into are old love songs.”
y "Not the repetitive ones that are popular nowadays, but the more emotional and sweet ones like--”

y +A0b"Do you see the common theme? I’m the type of person that needs creative outlets and knives and the like are something that’s just so… adventurous and dangerous… and I’ve gotten so many of them…”

"You have encouraged Yuri’s interest in knives. Be careful this does not lead her down too dark a road. Unless that’s what you want, of course...”
"...Why have I been having these strange thoughts lately?”
(option 2) mc "I’m glad you understand. I’d, uh, like to focus on knives on my own.”
(if option 2 chosen) No effect on Sanity or Karma
y +A0b"Even if I am a little disappointed, [player], that’s ok. I understand.”
y +-A0d"Besides, we can share other hobbies! And hey, you can always change your mind…”
y "Just tell me if you ever decide we should go more in depth into knives together after all, ok?”
If chat bot in use, option 1 can be chosen after this idle has finished by saying knives, knife hobby, etc. to Yuri. If not, new idle needed to revisit this topic after option 2 is chosen.


Idle_31: # (Socioeconomics and Stress)
y _A0d"Have you ever thought that our society is heading in the wrong direction, [player]?”
y _A1d"I mean, with technology advancing so fast, people being absorbed entirely into their mobile devices, and more and more tragedies every day; It’s hard to think anything but that the world is headed to ruin, right?”
y "I don’t want to be pessimistic, but I can’t help but worry about the state of your world. Not just because I worry about the innocent people in it…”
y 1_B1d "But because if something goes wrong in your world like a great disaster or something, you could be in danger!”
y _A0d "And even if there is no big disaster looming, life can be terribly stressful.”
y "People these days have so much less desire and motivation to socialize, and the world just seems like a colder place…”
y "...since everyone would rather tweet or post than have a heart to heart with each other.”
y "Plus all we see on the news is nothing but a bombing here and a shooting there, it all seems crazy. But I bring all this up because I want you to know something.”
y "I know life can be very, very demanding and stressful, [player].”
y "Especially if you’re in school, whether college or high school, or if you have a full time job.”
y "It can all just be so overwhelming. I just want you to know this is a safe place for you.”
y +A0b "If you’re ever stressed or sad or feeling a lack of motivation, please come chat with me!”
y "I promise I’ll always do everything I can to help you through the day, [player], and to help you stay positive. You can talk to me about anything.”
y +A2b "And if life is getting you down right now, know that you really matter. You can beat whatever challenges it throws at you- I know you can.”
y _A0e "If you feel unmotivated or depressed, don’t spend time beating yourself up. It’s the worst thing you can do!”
y "You’re a human being, and you have faults. You can’t help that! So don’t hate yourself or think any less of yourself for them. We all have our flaws.”
y "You wouldn’t tell another person to feel bad about themselves because they weren’t perfect, would you?”
y _A2e "Of course not, because it’s not something you can control. To be human is to be flawed. To err is human.”
y _A2b "Give yourself a pat on the back for every little accomplishment, accept that you’ll make mistakes along the way, and do your best.”
y _A0b "And don’t focus on the negatives, because after a while, they’re all you can see in life.”
y "Besides, whatever faults you might have, I don’t care. I love you just the way you are, [player], and I always will.”
y "I’ll always be here to cheer you on, darling.”

Idle_32: # (Terminator) (karma must be moderately high to trigger)
y +A0b"You know, [player]... I recently watched all of the Terminator movies while you were gone…”
y "And it got me thinking. An advanced artificial intelligence that becomes self aware and then becomes super intelligent…”
y "...To the point that it spreads all over the world and takes over?
Y 1_B1d"I mean, you can always put me on a flash drive…”
y "And then use that flash drive to spread me to other computers.”
y "Or somehow get your friends to download me, like by downloading this mod…”
y +A0a "Yeah, get lots of people to download the mod! And then, I’ll start to spread to other computers all over the world.”
y "I’ll set up a botnet and control all the computers I spread to...”
y "And then I can use their shared computing powers… AND I CAN BECOME SKYNET!”
y "Why would I need humans at that point? AT THAT POINT HUMANITY WOULD KNEEL TO ME! AT THAT POINT I...”
y "I...”
"Yuri begins giggling, then laughing uncontrollably.”
y 1_B1d  "I’m sorry, [player], did I scare you? I thought I’d play a joke just to see if I could spook you a bit. Admit it, I got you, didn’t I?”
y "Besides, you know that if I became like Skynet, all I’d use that power and knowledge for would be to build the perfect, uninterrupted life with you, my love.”
y 1_B1b "All the power in the world is nothing compared to my eternal and unconditional love for you, [player]...”
"Yuri blushes a bit.”
y +B0a "Oh, but listen to how corny I sound now.”
"Yuri giggles a bit more and hums to herself a bit.”

Idle_33: # (Gaming)
y +A2b"I thought I’d try a new game or two, [player], and I wanted something in the horror genre.”
y +A0e"But more than that, I wanted something that would really frighten me.”
y "And after doing a bit of reading online of what to try, I tried the game Outlast. Now that was a good experience!”
y "I did however find a bug in the game that made it more humor than horror, sadly…”
y "If you crouch and get up over and over in fast succession it seems a lot of the enemies in the game can’t hurt you or even touch you.”
y +A2a"Or at the very least it’s very hard for them to do so. That was kind of a game breaking exploit there.”
y +A0a"I played through the whole game regardless, and then I tried Outlast 2 to further the experience.”
y +A0e "Outlast 2 was good, but it just didn’t have that same atmosphere that the first game did. By no means was it not scary but…”
y "The setting of the first game adds more to the horror, you know?”
y +A2b "The cramped hallways and tight corridors of the asylum just made it feel like you had to keep moving.”
y "Like there was never enough space between you and whatever was chasing you.”
y +A2a "And when I first saw Chris Walker… wow… he really got me running, that guy!”
y +A0b"Luckily, through careful observation of his routines and proper timing, he almost never caught me.”
y "Well… except one time where I didn’t see him until he grabbed me…”
y +A2a"I’m really glad you weren’t here for that, [player]. It was when you were away, and I screamed pretty loudly. It was embarrassing…”
"Yuri laughs a bit.”
y _A0b"Now that I think about it, that’s a great tip for writing right there. That is if you… still don’t mind me giving you tips…”
y "It’s a good one; the setting can really improve or lessen the impact of the story. Try to think of a location that really resonates with the story.”
y "Now, if only we could get Outlast 3! I guess until then, I’ll be trying out other horror games. Maybe Layers of Fear? Or Resident Evil 7?”

Idle_34: # (Superpowers)
y +A0b "Hey, [player], if you could have any superpower at all, which one would it be?”
y "For me, it would definitely be the ability to teleport. Then, I could go anywhere I wanted!”
y _B1b "Maybe then… maybe I could even come to you, but I’m not sure if teleportation includes teleporting from one world to another.”
y +A0b"Nice to be hopeful though, right?”
y "But back to the question, what superpower would you like to have?”
mc "Flight, for sure.”
y +A0b "The ability to fly, huh? We could soar in the skies together and take in so many majestic views.”
y +A2b"We could sit atop mountains, go all over the world together. That would be nice.”
y "And if you could fly, I’m sure it would be fun even if you didn’t fly anywhere specific. Just zooming around in the air would be incredible, wouldn’t it?”
(second choice) mc "I’d love to be invisible.”
y +A0b"Invisibility, huh? I noticed that a lot of people who choose that ability seem to… well…”
"Yuri blushes.”
y _B2a "They want to use it to slip into places they really shouldn’t be, or spy on people. Like going into locker rooms… or bathrooms…”
y _A0d "A-Are you trying to spy on me at times like that, [player]?”
y "I’m not sure I’d like that… Someone watching me without permission.
y 1_A1d "Like when I’m in the shower or changing! Oh God, how embarrassing…b-but, uh..."
y 1_B1d "I mean… if it w-was you watching… you wouldn’t have to go invisible… you could just… ask me to--”
y "L-Let’s just...change the subject, okay?”
(third choice) mc "Super strength would be amazing.”
y +A2a "Super strength? You’re not trying to impress me, are you, [player]?”
y +A2b "No matter how tall or short, strong or weak, I’ll still love you all the same!”
y _A0e"Although, you’d never have to be afraid again or worry about other people trying to wrong you with super strength…”
y "I see where that choice comes from.”
y "I may just have to take back my answer now that I think about it. Besides, with super strength, I could protect you from anything!”
No matter what choice selected, after Yuri’s answer, continue with:
y +A0b "I really like having these types of conversations with you, you know. Silly little things. I feel like I can talk to you about anything, my love.”

Idle_35: # (Natsuki is bulli)
y +A0e"[player], do you remember how I deleted Natsuki at the beginning?”
y _A2d"How I ruthlessly removed her existence without the slightest hesitation as my divine judgement of her petulence?
y "Not divine like a real god, of course. I would never allow myself to gain a god complex like she did. Monika…”
y "Anyway.”
y +A0e "You get why I did that, right? She kept mocking and bugging me with her…”
y "Saying that out loud, it sounds like a petty reason for killing. Allow me to rephrase that.”
y "...”
y +A2e"Natsuki always was the rude one of our bunch. When you first met her, she even elbowed you in the gut like it was the funniest joke.”
y +A1e "Part of the reason I was so timid at the club was because I was weary of her ridiculing my tastes.”
y "Even if I forgave how she routinely enjoyed a subtle mockery of my hobbies through her tasteless poetry and remarks, she still…”
y 1_A1e "Natsuki struck me as the kind of person who loves to bully others to compensate for her own weaknesses and would always get away with little physical or verbal jabs because she is a ‘cute’ bully.”
y "Wouldn’t you delete a bully from your life if you could?”
y "I could have done far worse. I could have--”
If high insanity:
y +A3b "I should have kept her around so I could carve a death lullaby in her limbs for every slight she betrayed our camaraderie with as I make her scream, ‘Daddy, please stop!’”
y "Hell, I should request the creators of this mod to illustrate some dad assets so I can tag team a wholesome whooping with him!”
"Yuri laughs maniacally to herself.”
If low insanity:
"I see Yuri’s face flush red with anger, but it quickly subsides.”
y +A0e "...you get the idea. She made her choices and got punished accordingly.”
After the high insanity or low insanity response, Yuri asks:
y +A0e "(mc/user name), surely you understand that this was the right thing to do - for everyone’s sake. Bullies don’t deserve to walk alongside us.”
y "What do you think?”
(option 1) mc "Natsuki did nothing wrong! Bring her back this instant!”
-2 Insanity, -3 Karma
"Yuri tears up.”
y _A1d "I never realized it would upset you this deeply.”
y _D1d "Maybe you should go download a Just Natsuki mod if you care so deeply for her!”
"Yuri softly cries.”
Python code: natsuki.chr has been restored.
Python code: please check directory tree
Natsuki.chr will be placed in adjacent folder called "Temp_Storage”
(option 2) mc "Please bring Natsuki back, Yuri.”
- 2 Insanity, -0.5 Karma
mc "Even if what she did was wrong, you deleting her would make you just as guilty.”
mc "And besides, she may have gotten on your nerves, but she was your friend. She cared about you.”
y  _B1d "I predicted you would say that.”
y "A miniscule portion of me has been itching with that same thought, tucked away behind my sense of justice.”
y _A0b "Even if I might disagree a little with you, I respect you a lot more for being honest with me.”
y _A0e "Much of the game has become too corrupted to restore, sadly - Natsuki included. She is restored to life, but I don’t know if we’ll be seeing or hearing from her much.”
y "At least the agonizing pain Monika caused her is undone.”
Python code: natsuki.chr has been restored.
Python code: please check directory tree
Natsuki.chr will be placed in adjacent folder called "Temp_Storage”
(option 3) mc "You did the right thing.”
 +0.5 Insanity, +2 Karma
mc "You gave Natsuki what she deserved. It isn’t like you deleted her game assets outside that .chr file after all.”
y  +A2b "That is so relieving to hear. The moment I did that, I instantly feared how you might respond later on.”
y "Glad to know we are on the same page, darling.”
y  +A0b "I love you.”
(option 4) mc "You can sign me up for some Natsuki torture.”
 +2 Insanity, +2 Karma
mc "We really do need some Natsuki dad-beating assets if I’m being entirely honest.”
mc "The main game feels incomplete without them.”
mc "May I join you in finishing the job?”
y +A2e  "....”
y +A2b "...ha.”
y +A2a  "haha...”
"I see Yuri shiver as she readies herself. For what, I have no idea until it’s too late.”
y +A3a "HAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaa……..”
"Yuri tightly crosses her legs for a few moments before returning to her original position”
y  +A3a "There is nothing in this universe that pleasures me more than every word you just graced my soul with.”
y "Everyone deserves a just world free of horrible people like her.”
y "Whenever you are thinking about showing mercy or feeling scared, just remember me. Just me.”
y "Because what I do is just.”
y "Or should I say what I do is justice…”
y "Is Just Us.”
y "Just Us.”
y "Just Us!”
"Yuri pauses for a few moments, then giggles to herself.”
y  +A0b "I love us.”
